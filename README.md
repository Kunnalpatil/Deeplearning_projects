# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two Deep learning projects: Customer Churn Prediction using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

## Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting customer churn. The application is built using Streamlit and TensorFlow.

### Project Structure

- `app.py`: Streamlit application code for customer churn prediction.
- `experiment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `model.h5`: Trained ANN model file.
- `label_encoder_gender.pkl`: Pickle file for the label encoder for gender.
- `Onehotencoder.pkl`: Pickle file for the one-hot encoder.
- `scaler.pkl`: Pickle file for the scaler.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.


## Project 2: IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. The application is built using Streamlit and TensorFlow.

### Project Structure
- `main.py`: Streamlit application code for IMDB movie review sentiment analysis.
- `prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading data, building, training, and evaluating the RNN model.
- `embedding.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploring word embeddings.
- `simple_rnn_imdb.h5`: Trained RNN model file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
